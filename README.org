#+TITLE: Ultimate Org Capture Extension

The goal of this extension is to make the bridge between org and your browser, so
that you can integrate your life with org.

In the future I'd love for this extension to even recognize how certain pages
should be bookmarked (example for [[http://oremacs.com/2015/01/07/org-protocol-1/][youtube videos]]) . Also I wrote a [[http://cestdiego.github.io/blog/2015/08/19/org-protocol/][blog post]] on
how to make this work with your Emacs. Currently it only stores links, provided
that you have the Emacs part ready as stated in the blog post you shouldn't have
any trouble.
